Summary <br>
The visualization documents the chance of survival of different types of passengers. With this visualization, you will better understand the consequence of the event and how people react to such accident. 

Design - explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback <br>

- A normalized stacked bar chart in order to reflect clearly the survival chance of passengers
- Actual number of passengers to the graph to let the audience to have a grasp on actual data
- X-axis and Y-axis texts are modified to let the audience intuitively understand the graphs
- Bars are ordered descendingly according to their percentage in order to give the audience a stronger visual impact

Feedback - include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

Feedback (1) <br>
1. What do you notice in the visualization? <br>
There are two colors to determine the survival rate of different categories of passengers<br>

2. What questions do you have about the data? <br>
Why there are data with N/A in age group?<br>
what is the total number of passengers<br>
Any stat about their nationality or their race?<br>

3. What relationships do you notice? <br>
The survival rate of female and child is higher, yet it is still depends on their class<br>

4. What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization? <br>
You can understand their thoughts when they were facing the death. Senior people and male were more <br>likely to let their children and wife to get on the safety boat first.<br>

5. Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?<br>
So, which of the factor is more influencing? And i would like to see the combined factors by group. <br>So that, we can draw a conclusion on the above question<br>

Feedback (2) <br>
1. What do you notice in the visualization? <br>
You can understand the titanic passenger from multiple perspectives<br>

2. What questions do you have about the data? <br>
Is it possible to acknowledge the limitations due to N/A data somewhere (or to what extent it affects the trend shown)?<br>

3. What relationships do you notice? <br>
Age and gender are stronger factors compared to class<br>

4. What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization? <br>
No specific takeaway<br>

5. Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?<br>
Why do female children in class 2 show the highest survival rate, whereas class 1 female children are not even among the first 5? <br>

Feedback(3)<br>
- Using a rate for the y-axis is an excellent design choice. An effective complement to this would be <br>to add the raw numbers to the tooltip. Currently the tooltip also displays percent, but under the label "PassengerID"<br>
- I enjoyed the combined factors plot and I really like how it is ordered by survival rate. The x-axis <br>labels are challenging to see. Consider expanding the width of this plot possibly in conjunction with an increase in label font size.
